<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  Hi, I’m James. I currently work as an Operations Manager at FedEx, where I focus on optimizing processes and leading a dedicated team to ensure smooth operations. My career keeps me on my toes, but it’s my passion for technology that truly excites me. I’m an avid enthusiast of computers and technology, and I’m diving into the world of coding with great enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>When I’m not immersed in tech or managing operations, I love spending quality time with my wonderful family. I’m blessed with a supportive wife and two amazing daughters who bring joy and adventure into my life every day.
</p>
<p>
  In essence, I’m a tech-savvy professional with a love for learning, a dedicated family man, and always looking for the next challenge—whether it's in the world of technology or at home with my loved ones.
